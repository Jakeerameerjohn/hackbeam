Overview 
Lightcast's Global data is designed to best enable international comparisons. As with the creation of the 
Lightcast Occupation Taxonomy
 
to normalize different global occupation standards, Lightcast provides data in the global tool for standardized local 
Lightcast Administrative Areas
 within each 
Country
. 
 
The goal of the Lightcast Administrative Area's (LAA's for short) is to create a unified geographic mapping of data that corresponds with the local governmental definitions of those area's. 
 
Global Metropolitan regions
Talent Analyst uses the Metropolitan Area definitions of the Lightcast Administrative Area framework to filter and display localized data. Since official 'metropolitan areas' are defined on national or regional levels, we utilize 
Lightcast Administrative Areas
 to ensure that we're comparing similar metropolitan areas globally. 
 
Metropolitan definitions are based on government defined regions, in most cases coming direct from local authorities. For example, US Metros are based on the Office of Management and Budget's 
Metropolitan Statistical Areas
. 
The table below demonstrates the breadth by country.

FAQs
What are Lightcast Administrative Areas?
The geographical locations associated with our global dataset are defined by Lightcast Administrative Areas, or LAAs. These are geocodes, or statistical divisions of a country for ease of analysis. They align with local geocode standards in each country that Lightcast maintains data for, for example the 
NUTS area codes
 across the European Union, and the 
FIPS subdivisions
 of the United States.
Why isn't a particular metro area available within the global metros? 
Metropolitan definitions are based on government defined regions, in most cases coming direct from local authorities. Lightcast has a threshold in each country to maintain a manageable number of metropolitan areas. Refer to the table above to determine the specific local definitions and the threshold in each country.
Do global metros cover entire nations? 
No. Global metros do not exhaustively cover a country's area. Smaller regions areas are included in national estimates but not specifically addressed within the "metropolitan" areas of the global tool. 
 
How does Lightcast classify postings to geographical locations?
Lightcast collects many thousands of job postings per day from around the world. The text of these postings is analyzed for place names which are singled out and recorded as the raw location associated with that posting. Only one location is saved per posting.
‚Äã
This raw location is submitted to Google geocoding to derive the latitude and longitude of the location. All other other location data (such as city, county, state,  Lightcast Administrative Areas, etc) is assigned from those values.
‚Äã
‚Äã
 
Note
On February 14th we are making a change to the methodology used to classify 
Lightcast Administrative Areas
.
 
Previously, if no lower-level administrative area was present, we would not classify the country level. Going forward, if a location is available only at the national level, the country will now be classified.
