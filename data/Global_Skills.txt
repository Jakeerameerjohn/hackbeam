Skills are a foundational translation layer that enables a standardized way to compare and evaluate job requirements across different languages and cultures, allowing for accurate talent matching and identification of skill gaps.
 
In order to accurately analyze global job postings, it's important to understand language to avoid misinterpretations or missing important details, and to address language barriers that can impact analysis.
Skills are a great way of understanding global labor;
Granularity: Skills provide a granular level of detail
Comparability: Skills are a universal language
Future-proofing: Skills provide a future-oriented perspective
The use of skills to analyze labor demand data supports granular and contextual data-driven decision-making.

Lightcast does not machine translates data in order to tag skills through an English classifier. All our skills extraction happens in native language.
Skills are tagged by looking at the full context of the posting, this allows us to accurately determine if a posting is asking for a Python programmer at a startup versus a Python animal caretaker at a zoo. This context is all done in the language of the document and 
not
 through a machine translation to English for maximum accuracy. 
 
Currently, Lightcast global skills are tagged in the following languages;
