How does Lightcast classify location to our postings data?
 
Updated over a month ago
Lightcast collects many thousands of job postings per day from around the world. The text of these postings is analyzed for place names which are singled out and recorded as the raw location associated with that posting. Only one location is saved per posting.
‚Äã
This raw location is submitted to Google geocoding to derive the latitude and longitude of the location. All other other location data (such as city, county, state,  
Lightcast Administrative Areas
, etc) is assigned from those values.
